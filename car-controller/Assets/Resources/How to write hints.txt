===================

So the structure is like this:
levelhint_LEVEL_HINT.txt

Where LEVEL is the level you want it to appear on,
and HINT is the hint number.

Levels starts counting at 0 and hints starts counting at 1. (confusing right?)
This is because hint 0 is actually the level STORY, which will display first time that level loads.

The algorithm at the moment requires the hint number to start at 1 and increment the filename.
One gap makes it ignore the ones after the gap.
Example:
levelhint_0_1
levelhint_0_2
levelhint_0_4 <-- WONT BE INCLUDED

The level number can skip some though.
If theres no hint with hint number 1 for a level, the help button is grayed out on that level.
Example:
levelhint_0_1
levelhint_2_1 <-- SKIPPED SECOND LEVEL. BUT THATS OK
levelhint_3_2 <-- NO HINT NR1 SO WILL BE GRAYED OUT

===================

# WRITING HINTS

This is really simple.

The first row defines the title.
The rest defines the hints content.

# ADDING IMAGES

The system supports 1 image per hint.
To add an image, you just have a sprite with the same name as the levelhint.txt file.
Something that is important to note is that the images Texture Type must be marked as Sprite in Import Settings.
Otherwise they will probably not be counted as sprites, and it will be ignored.

Example:
levelhint_1_1.txt
levelhint_1_1.png <-- WILL BE USED IN THE HINT

# RICH TEXT

Not only does it support images, it also supports Unitys Rich Text.
Rich Text is kinda like HTML on sleeping pills.

You can change the style (bold, italic), size, and color.

Examples:
Bold:	<b>example</b>
Italic:	<i>example</i>
Size:	<size=32>example</size>
Color:	<color=green>example</color>
    	<color=#ffffff40>example</color>
    	^ here the 40 is actually the opacity in hex

===================

# NOTE 1:

Demo levels and hints/stories are not compatiple with each other!
Having a levelmanus_X file will result in the hints being ignored.

# NOTE 2:

The system is not that smart and cannot differentiate between lower and uppercase.
For this reason the following names will not work:

Levelhint_1_1.txt
LEVELHINT_2_1.txt
levelHint_3_1.txt
1eve1hint_l_l.txt <-- ones and L are switched with each other.
